# Internship-Deep-Learning-in-the-Automotive-Industry
 This project is part of my engineering internship at Capgemini Engineering. The main objective of the project is to develop an innovative solution that utilizes web scraping (data collection from online sources) and deep learning to accurately predict car sales (predicting whether a car is a good or bad deal).
